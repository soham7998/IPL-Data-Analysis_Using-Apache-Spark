# IPL-Data-Analysis_Using Apache-Spark

Here are the things I have done.

•Basics of Apache Spark (architecture, transformation, action, lazy evaluation)

•Creating a Databricks account and the basics of it

•Structured API and how to write transformation functions

•Using SQL to analyze IPL Data

•Building visualization to gain more insights

The goal of this project is to give you an overall understanding of Apache Spark and its different functions to write transformation blocks on top of that you will learn SQL to analyze data and build visualization.
